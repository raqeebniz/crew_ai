# CrewAI Learning Repository

Welcome to the **crew_ai** repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive learning resource for CrewAI, covering various topics, workflows, and example agents. CrewAI is a powerful framework for orchestrating AI agents efficiently, enabling them to work collaboratively on complex tasks.

## üìå Repository Overview
This repository includes:
- Learning resources and notes on CrewAI concepts.
- Implementations of different agentic patterns.
- Example agents demonstrating CrewAI workflows.
- Integration with LiteLLM for efficient LLM routing.

## üèóÔ∏è Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to CrewAI**
   - Overview of CrewAI and its capabilities
   - Comparison with other agent orchestration frameworks
   
2. **Understanding Crew & Agents**
   - Defining and structuring AI agents
   - Crew composition and task delegation

3. **Roles & Specialization**
   - Assigning roles to agents (Researcher, Coder, Summarizer, etc.)
   - Optimizing performance through specialization

4. **Task Management & Workflows**
   - Designing effective agent workflows
   - Task delegation and execution strategies

5. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
   - Communication and coordination between agents
   - Handling dependencies in agentic workflows

6. **Routing with LiteLLM**
   - Integrating LiteLLM for cost-efficient API calls
   - Dynamic LLM selection based on task complexity

7. **Example Agents & Use Cases**
   - Research Agent: Gathers and summarizes information
   - Coding Agent: Generates and refactors code
   - Content Writer Agent: Produces structured content
   - Data Analysis Agent: Processes and visualizes data

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install crewai litellm openai
  ```
- Set up API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Running Example Agents
To run an example agent:
```bash
python examples/research_agent.py
```
Modify the examples according to your use case!

## üìö Resources
- [CrewAI Documentation](https://github.com/CrewAI/crewai)
- [LiteLLM GitHub](https://github.com/berriai/LiteLLM)

## ü§ù Contributing
Feel free to contribute by adding new patterns, improving workflows, or optimizing agent implementations. Submit a pull request with your improvements!
